SeeCloud is a novel visual composing system created to address the bottlenecks associated with provisioning and managing access control in AWS Identity & Access Management (IAM). SeeCloud simplifies the AWS IAM provisioning process by allowing users to easily set up their access control through SeeCloud's diagramming interface. SeeCloud will automatically generate an AWS CloudFormation code from the composed diagram through its diagram interpreter. SeeCloud is also equipped with an integrated change manager that allows users to easily generate pull requests and automatically deploy merged changes to their AWS account. Additionally, SeeCloud offers a graph-based access analyzer engine that allows users to validate their access schema against a specified security property. The project is built as a full-stack application, with React on the frontend and Node with Express on the backend.
